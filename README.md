# DD1338 Week 12

This week we finaly get to a task that many of you (assumption by Tobbe) (no u) have been looking forward to. It is time to create a game!

## Game Requirements

The game you are about to create must meet the following two requirements:

1) The game must be a 1v1 game, meaning player-player, AI-player or AI-AI. Other than that, be creative!
2) Next week's task will be to write AI scripts for each other's games. Therefore it is important that you create your game in such a way that you _can_ create an AI for it!

The game itself can be anything that you want it to be, make something fun or creative, but remember that even something like Pong is good enough for a pass as long as you follow our requirements!

> Tobias: There is no requirement on graphics. As long as we can _see_ the game it should be fine.

> Viola: Although, graphics are better than ASCII xP

### Getting into groups

For this assignment we want you to pair up in two. If you get left out of a group, invite yourself as a third member somewhere. This is a tip-top (tip tippity top) oppertunity for you to test your argumentation skills to try and convince a fellow class member of your obviously superior formatting. 

### Prepare Assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID1>-<KTH_ID2>-game` (or `KTH_ID1-KTH_ID2-KTH_ID3-game`) under the `INDAPlus21` organisation and clone it (Yes, it applies to you too ~~silly~~ Mighty @Haskellers!).
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and start writing.

No example this week! (labbhösten is brutal) (Trean är ganska chill dock, man sitter mest och skrattar åt tvåan :grin:)

We don't have example code, but the ++TA Rickard has a similar game you can look at [here!](https://rick.ee/sidor/vertiball/).

### Grading

To make sure that we can grade (mercylessly judge/hysterically laugh at) your game, include in a `README.md` file of how to build/run your game. Other than that, we want a functional game that means the requirements specified under [Game Requirements](Game-Requirements).

**Note**: Eventually you'll have to write painfully clear documentation of how to write an AI for your game. This can be done either this week or in a hurry next week.
